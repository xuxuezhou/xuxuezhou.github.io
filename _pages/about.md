I currently work as a visiting scholar at [ECE](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/), [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/) under the supervision of [Prof. Xingyu Li](https://xingyul.github.io/).

I completed my undergraduate studies with highest distinction at the National University of Singapore, majoring in Mathematics with a minor in Computer Science.

Prior to that, I had the honor to work in the [Tsinghua SAIL Group](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), supervised by [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) and [Prof. Hang Su](http://www.suhangss.me/).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on robot learning and reinforcement learning, especially in manipulation. I aim to build universal robotic models to assist manipulators to deal with diverse tasks.
