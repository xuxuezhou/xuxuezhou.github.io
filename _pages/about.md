Iâ€™m a visiting scholar in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://cde.nus.edu.sg/ece/) at the [National University of Singapore](https://nus.edu.sg/), advised by [Prof. Xingyu Liu](https://xingyul.github.io/).

I completed my B.Sc. in Mathematics (Highest Distinction) with a minor in Computer Science at NUS.

Previously, I worked in [Tsinghua SAIL Group](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/) with [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) and [Prof. Hang Su](http://www.suhangss.me/).

## Research Interests

My research focuses on robot learning and reinforcement learning, especially in manipulation. I aim to build universal robotic models to assist manipulators to deal with diverse tasks.
